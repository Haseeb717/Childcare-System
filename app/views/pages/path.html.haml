          %h4 Designed to complement your busy schedule
          %p Our ongoing Program is designed so your staff can receive training without interrupting their regular work. Once you start, your childcare facility will get access to a new module every two weeks so your staff can effectively integrate what they learn at a natural pace. After only 90 days of training, your facility will gain Accreditation--provided that the instruction and implementation components have been put into practice. The value of accreditation continues and is reinforced by yearly reaccreditation.

            Adequate training is an important component of a successful daycare center. Knowledge of infection control is the first step in rooting out the causes of the spread of diseases and their risk to children and employees.

                  Training reduces guesswork, replacing it with confidence and proactive conduct on the part of your employees. This lowers employee stress, reduces employee turnover and motivates your employees to thrive. Appropriate training for a given scenario can even save lives.

Therefore, the health-preserving practices of your staff and children’s parents can positively affect generations to come

All participants will have access to tools that will enable them to record the best practices as they apply them. Therefore, as a childcare facility operator, you can track, measure and ensure that the infection preventive best practices are implemented and upheld.
